# prism-master-detail
A simple xamarin.forms demo using prism master-detail

Populates 3 classes (Customer, Address, Product) with random data from some JSON files.
Uses Prism Master-Detail to display a list of all customers in the master and the
details for each customer on the details page.

Note: in the android project VS reports an 'ambiguity' error in the MainActivity.cs file.
However it compiles and runs.
